/*
Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. The pro-
gram must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a nega-
tive number, the program must display the largest nonnegative number entered:
Enter a number: 60
Enter a number: 38.3
Enter a number: 4.89
Enter a number: 100.62
Enter a number: 75.2295
Enter a number: 0
The largest number entered was 100.62
Notice that the numbers arenâ€™t necessarily integers.

	double lfNumber, lfMax=0;

	do{
		printf("Enter a number: ");
		scanf("%lf", &lfNumber);

		if (lfNumber >= lfMax){
			lfMax = lfNumber;
		}

	}while (lfNumber != 0 && lfNumber > 0);

	printf("The largest number entered was %.lf\n", lfMax);
